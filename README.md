# Vision Model Exploration: CNNs VS Transformers

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the development of models from scratch for various computer vision tasks. Diverging from my usual work with transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models, this project focuses on building foundational knowledge and skills in constructing and training models from the ground up.

## Project Scope

The project covers three primary vision tasks, implemented using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based approaches:

- **Image Classification**
- **Image Segmentation**
- **Object Detection**

Each category is approached with models built and trained from scratch, facilitating a deep dive into the mechanics and capabilities of both CNNs and Transformers within the field of vision.

## Current Status

**Under-Construction** , The models and their corresponding tasks are being continuously updated and improved. Here's what's currently available and what to expect in future updates.

### Available Models

- **CNN-Based Model for Image Classification**: model that classify images into predefined categories.
- **CNN-Based Model for Semantic Segmentation**: Exploratory model using CNN architecture to perform semantic image segmentation.

### In Progress

- **Object Detection Model**: CNN-based model for precise object detection is currently being developed.

### Future

- **Transformer-Based Models**: Implementation of transformer-based models for the mentioned three tasks.

## Contribution

While the project is primarily an individual exploration, contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit pull requests.
